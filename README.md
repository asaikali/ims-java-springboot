The examples in this repository demonstrate how you can access IMS transactions or databases using Spring Boot. 

* [IMS synchronous callout processing with Spring Boot](https://github.com/imsdev/ims-java-springboot/tree/master/ims-springboot-callout)
* [Accessing IMS transactions using IMS TM Resource Adapter with connection pooling](https://github.com/imsdev/ims-java-springboot/tree/master/ims-springboot-tm)
* JDBC access to IMS databases <i>(coming soon)</i>

## Featured technologies

* [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/): An open source application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
* [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)</a>: Spring Boot is a framework developed on top of the Spring framework to ease the development of new Spring applications. 
* [IMS TM Resource Adapter](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPH2_14.1.0/com.ibm.ims14.doc.tmra/topics/tmresoverview.htm): 
A Java EE connector architecture (JCA)-compliant resource adapter that allows Java applications or services to access IMS transactions via IMS Connect. It also enables IMS applications to call out to external Java applications or services.
* [IMS Universal JDBC driver](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPH2_14.1.0/com.ibm.ims14.doc.apg/ims_odbjdbcintro.htm): 
A driver for SQL-based database connectivity to access IMS databases over TCP/IP.
